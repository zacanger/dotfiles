This is a Textadept module for spell checking. Install it in your
`~/.textadept/modules/` directory and load it from your `~/.textadept/init.lua`:

    _M.spellcheck = require('spellcheck')

By default the `F7` key starts interactive spell check and `Shift+F7` marks all
misspelled words in the buffer. If you prefer to use the mouse, left-clicking on
misspelled words will display suggestions. There is also a submenu in the
"Tools" menu for spell checking.

User dictionaries are located in the `~/.textadept/dictionaries/` directory, and
Textadept will load any dictionary file in that directory automatically.
Dictionary files are Hunspell dictionaries and follow the Hunspell format: the
first line contains the number of entries in the dictionary followed by one word
per line.

By default, Textadept will only check the spelling of words in plain text,
comments, and strings. You can expand this by altering the
`_M.spellcheck.spellcheckable_styles` table.

Also by default, Textadept spell checks the buffer each time it is saved,
highlighting any misspelled words. The `_M.spellcheck.CHECK_SPELLING` option
controls this behavior.

For utilizing spell check via Lua API, please see the `spell.luadoc` and
`spellchecker.luadoc` files.
